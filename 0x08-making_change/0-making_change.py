Task:
    Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the
    + fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total.

    Return: fewest number of coins needed to meet total
    If total is 0 or less, return 0
    If total cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return -1
    coins is a list of the values of the coins in your possession
    The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than 0
    You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of

    Your solutionâ€™s runtime will be evaluated in this task
